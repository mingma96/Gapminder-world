The visualisation is able to present information about countries in the world during 10 years from 2007 to 2017. It provides flexiable interaction for users to control the visualisation to meet their demands of visiable data. The vistualiasation can anminatedly show the data for each country changing by different years, as well as the options to view the data for a certain year.

In the first canvas, each country is represented by a single circle, with the radius of th circle reflecting the population of the country. In this canvas, two mainly concerned attributes is GDP, as shown in x-axis, and Global_Competitiveness_Index, as shown in y-axis. A core issue is to appropriately scale the data to create the axis and present the position of circles. Based on the ranges of each attributes, linear scale is used for y-axis scaling, because the index varys in a restricted range and is easy to scale. But log scale is used for x-axis, as in the data set GDP have huge changings and differences, so applying log scale can punish the extreme number and guarantee the circles are all positioned in a appropriate area. Also, the colors of each circle show information that to which region the country belongs. There are labels to help users understand the corresponding region of each color.

The number of countries brings numerous circles in the canvas, so to avoid too intensive labels, the country names are not shown by default, but are only visiable when mouse is moving upon them. To highlight certain countries, users can simply click on circles, and the country name can also appear and move along with the circle.

The set of buttons provide easy control of the display year and starting/stoping the movement of circles with years changing. There is also a button to clear the selection, which resets the canvas without any highlights. A button is designed to switch on/off the presentation of trails. In the active mode, the moving tracks of each selected countries would be shown in the canvas and this can be turned off anytime.

The second canvas shows individual pillars of selected countries in the first canvas, and labels for understanding each pillar are also displayed. If two or more countries are selected, this canvas can provide dynamically comparations between countries.
